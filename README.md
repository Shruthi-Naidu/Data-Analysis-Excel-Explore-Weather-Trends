### Summary

In this project, local and global temperature data are analyzed and the temperature trends are compared to where you live to overall global temperature trends.
I performed data analysis using descriptive statistics and created graphical visualizations using MS Excel to highlight the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the selected geographical location.
